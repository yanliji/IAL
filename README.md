# Independency-Adversarial-Learning-IAL-
As sound overlapping always badly hinders accurate sound separation, we propose an Independency Adversarial Learning based Cross-Modal Sound Separation (IAL) approach, where IAL employs the adversarial learning to minimize the correlation of separated sound elements, exploring high sound independence.
